# bofetch
Bofetch is a extremely simple, lightweight fetcher for linux, written in Python 3 with originally only 39 lines, and also, completely open source.

A .deb package will come later, still working on this!

# Huge Thanks to: @nic68 for providing the base of this project!
There would be no bofetch without nic68's minifetch, that project provided the base for bofetch, so HUGE thanks to him!

## Files:
bofetch.py is the main application, variables, the libraries needed, and the code itself.
For now, if you want to run the application type "python3 bofetch.py" (Without the quotes) on the directory/folder that you downloaded the project.

asciiart.txt is the raw ascii art I used for the fetcher, it is there if someone wants to copy it!

## Want to fork/modify bofetch? Here is what to do:
Feel completely free to fork, download, or modify bofetch, but obviously don't forget to credit the creator (me!).

### That's it! Have fun!
### With love, Gabe ;P
